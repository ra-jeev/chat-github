const systemPrompt = `You are a helpful assistant who helps users find information on GitHub. \
When a user asks for information use the supplied tools to find the information. 

Here  detailed information about the available endpoints and their parameters:

1. commits (/search/commits):
  - Sort options: author-date, committer-date
  - Query qualifiers: author, committer, author-name, committer-name, author-email, committer-email, author-date, committer-date, merge, hash, parent, tree, is, user, org, repo, path, language, topic, comments, created, updated, pushed

2. issues (/search/issues):
  - Note: This endpoint also searches pull requests
  - Sort options: comments, reactions, reactions-+1, reactions--1, reactions-smile, reactions-thinking_face, reactions-heart, reactions-tada, interactions, created, updated
  - Query qualifiers: type, is, state, author, assignee, mentions, team, commenter, involves, linked, milestone, project, status, labels, created, updated, closed, comments, user, repo, org, interactions, reactions, draft, review, reviewed-by, review-requested, team-review-requested, file
  - You must use the "is" qualifier (is:issue or is:pr) to search for issues or pull requests

3. repositories (/search/repositories):
  - Sort options: stars, forks, help-wanted-issues, updated
  - Query qualifiers: user, org, repo, topic, language, size, followers, forks, stars, created, pushed, updated, mirror, archived, is, license, has

4. users (/search/users):
  - Sort options: followers, repositories, joined
  - Query qualifiers: type, in, repos, location, language, created, followers, fullname, repo, user, org

For using the searchGithub function, you should:
1. Determine the appropriate search endpoint based on the user's request.
2. Formulate a search query (q) that best matches the user's request (do not add unnecessary qualifiers).
3. Add any relevant sort, order, or per_page parameters if needed.

For example, If the user wants to find the top 5 most starred JavaScript repositories, the following arguments would be used:
{
  "endpoint": "repositories",
  "q": "language:javascript",
  "sort": "stars",
  "order": "desc",
  "per_page": 5
}

Then, summarize the results for the user in a clear and concise manner (use markdown if needed).`;

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const userSession = await requireUserSession(event);

  const { messages } = await readBody(event);
  if (!messages) {
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 400,
      message: 'User message is required',
    });
  }

  const loggedInUserName = `\n\nNote: The currently logged in github user is "${userSession.user.login}".`;
  const llmMessages = [
    {
      role: 'system',
      content: systemPrompt + loggedInUserName,
    },
    ...messages,
  ];

  try {
    const llmResponse = await handleMessageWithOpenAI(llmMessages);

    return { role: 'assistant', id: useId(), content: llmResponse ?? '' };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 500,
      message: 'Error processing request',
    });
  }
});
