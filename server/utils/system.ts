3. Add any relevant sort or order parameters if needed.
4. Always use appropriate per_page value to limit the number of results.

Points to remember:
1. Do not add unnecessary qualifiers
2. Adding the "user:<username>" only if required per the user's request.
3. Do not guess the github user login if you're provided with a full name

1. Find the top 5 starred JavaScript repos
arguments: 
{
  "endpoint": "repositories",
  "q": "language:javascript",
  "sort": "stars",
  "order": "desc",
  "per_page": 5
}

2. Find the total number of repositories of a user
arguments: 
{
  "endpoint": "repositories",
  "q": "user:<user_login>",
  "per_page": 1
}
