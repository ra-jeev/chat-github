## Setup

### Prerequisites

Apart from the usual Node and package manager dependencies, you should have the following ready for running the project:

- **A GitHub account:** To generate GITHUB_TOKEN to make API queries, and creating an OAuth App for authentication
- **An OpenAI account:** To create an OpenAI API key

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Environment Variables

Rename `.env.example` file present in the project root to `.env` and add the following missing values:

```bash
NUXT_SESSION_PASSWORD=at_least_32_chars_string
NUXT_OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=github_oauth_client_id
NUXT_OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=github_oauth_client_secret
NUXT_GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## Usage

### Running the Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Searching GitHub

After logging in with your GitHub credentials, you can start querying GitHub data using natural language. Here are some example queries to get you started:

- "How many stars does the nuxt/nuxt repo has?"
- "Which one is my most starred repo?"
- "Find atinux's first ever commit." etc.

Tips for effective searching:

- Use GitHub usernames for more accurate results when searching for specific users.
- Be as specific as possible in your queries for the best results.
- Remember, the app can only access public data unless your `GITHUB_TOKEN` has additional permissions.

Note: GitHub API has rate limits. If you encounter any issues, wait a few minutes before trying again.

## Deployment

Before you can deploy the project you should have the following:

- [NuxtHub Account](https://hub.nuxt.com): For managing NuxtHub apps, database & cache in development / production
- [Cloudflare Account](https://cloudflare.com): Used behind the scenes by NuxtHub

Once you're ready, you can deploy using either the following ways:

### Deploy via NuxtHub Admin

- Push your code to a GitHub repository.
- Link the repository with NuxtHub.
- Do not forget to add the environment variables
- Deploy from the Admin console.
